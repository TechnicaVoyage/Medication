## Beta v0.1 21-Jul-2016 
- APK available for API 21+
- Cycle, duration, cooldown features available
- Repeat need to be added later (only XML is configured for it
This program lets user to enter a cycle for their medicine.
It takes in name of medicine, duration of cycle, duration of cooldown, time of alarm and repeat checkbox.
For eg: if someone needs to take Medicine A 21 days a in stretch, then not take it 7 days, want to get notified at 10 PM and they want this to keep going (no end), they will enter: 
A,21,7,10 PM,true.
It runs on min API 22 which is Android 5.1. I'm still developing it need to add drawables, sound. I might change it to be compatible in using Material UI.
